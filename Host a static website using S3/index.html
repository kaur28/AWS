    <p>My name is Gurleen Kaur, and this is my static website made using AWS S3. <br><br>
The first step was to open AWS console and login using the root user. <br><br>

Open S3 service and click on create bucket. The name of the bucket should be unique and not in caps. <br><br>

Once the bucket was created, we enabled the static website hosting in properties. <br><br>

In permisions, under block public access, clear the settings and save. <br><br>

Under permissions, edit bucket policy to make the website public. <br><br>

In properties, scroll down and find the website endpoint. That is the link to the publically viewable website. <br>
